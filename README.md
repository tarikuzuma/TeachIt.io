A sample application for our application that focuses on SDG 4

Abstractâ€” This research delves into the integration of Reddit's
dynamic "Hot" sorting algorithm within an innovative
educational platform, presenting a potential paradigm shift in
online learning. This tackles an in-depth explanation of what the
algorithm does and what drawbacks it has. Renowned for its
prowess in curating and prioritizing content, the algorithm's
adaptive approach ensures that educational material is organized
based on engagement, relevance, and user preferences. By aligning
closely with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education),
the platform creates a global learning community where users
contribute, learn, and adapt. The algorithm's incorporation of
upvote/downvote systems and a feedback mechanism enhances
content quality, fostering an environment where high-quality
educational material rises to prominence. This adaptability
extends to student-generated content, encouraging peer evaluation
and a verification process for credibility. Moreover, the app
contributes to other SDGs such as SDG 8 (Decent Work and
Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation,
Infrastructure). The implementation of the algorithm to the
application could play a pivotal role in enhancing education and
promoting innovation.
